Absolutely minimal version of GSIV to work with touch screens and very slow processors.

This code is not intended to be a final solution that you include in your project, it is intended to create a basic version that you need to read though, understand and customise to your particular needs.

You may want to look at:

PanoJS

	http://code.google.com/p/panojs/
	Works on iPhone, but slow on mobile phones with large images.

GSIV
	http://www.mojavelinux.com/projects/panojs/
	Where PanoJS came from, but does not support touch events.

Zoomify
	http://www.zoomify.com/
	Original idea came from, but also has issues (and not open source).

ShiftZoom
	http://www.netzgesta.de/shiftzoom/
	Couldn't get the demos to work myself on a mobile phone.

jQuery UI
	http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
	Fairly basic draggable support (not complete solution - and adds too much).
